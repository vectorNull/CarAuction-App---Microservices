In a production environment, I would probably use something like AWS Cognito. I am only adding authentication to the auction service which allows users to create a new auction. Anonymous access will be allowed for other services.

# What I did not cover in this project:
- Refresh tokens
- Forgot Password functionality
- Email confirmation
- Consent
- 2FA

I may come back and add that. However, my main focus was microservices architecture.
