## Why Mass Transit?

- Message routing
- Exception Handling
- Dependency Injection
- Open Telemetry (OTEL) for activity tracking
- Test Harnessing

It also gives us some abrstraction in case we would like to switch to a different transport or service bus in the future, such as Azure Bus Service or Amazon SQS, without much hassle
